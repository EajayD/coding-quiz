# coding-quiz

This is a basic quiz on very basic terms and concepts of coding. The quiz is also timed and will penalize you if you make a mistake. Your score is based on how much time you have left, if you get a question wrong, then time is deducted from the total, thus affecting your score. The instructions will give more detail on how it exactly affects your score once you click the deployed link. Are you ready to test your knowledge?
